      <p><strong>Part 1: Mass Democracy</strong><br><strong>Part 2: Market Revolution<br>________________________________________________________</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Part 1: Towards Mass Democracy</strong><br><br>As the country expanded and added states, a voice was given to a group of people known at the time as “the common man.” No longer restricting the vote to the educated or property owners, most new western states included all free, white, male adults in the electorate. The power of the Eastern Elite waned as the strong and courageous, but uneducated, gained popularity.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Andrew Jackson had become a legend as a merciless but victorious Indian fighter who parlayed his military daring to defeat the British in the Battle of New Orleans, one of the few victories of the War of 1812. Orphaned as a youngster when he first fought both the British and their Indian allies, he was known as a self-made man who had become a plantation owner, slave owner, slave trader, and a Tennessee political leader before rising to the rank of general in the Militia. At the conclusion of the War of 1812 and the Indian Wars that followed, Jackson, whose only public expressions of tenderness were toward his wife Rachel who he had married before she was legally divorced from her first husband, had promised her that he was finally home for good to spend retirement with her at their Hermitage plantation. Responding to a friend’s urging to run for president, he had written that he was comfortable at the Hermitage and believed both favored candidates John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay would make good presidents. Only after learning the leading contender was former Secretary of War William H. Crawford, who had earned Jackson’s hatred after criticizing his conduct in the Indian Wars, did he go against Rachel’s pleadings to announce his candidacy for the presidency of the United States.</li>
  <li>John Quincy Adams was likely the most qualified man who ever ran for or served as president of the United States. The son of the second president of the United States, he had an intimate knowledge of the development of the country. As a boy he had watched from a nearby hilltop with his mother Abigail Adams as the British fired on his colonial neighbors at the Battle of Bunker Hill. As a teen he had traveled with his father John Adams to Paris where he continued his studies, &nbsp;tutored by Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and his father as negotiated treaties with France, England, and other European countries, sometimes serving as their clerk or errand boy. Having served as unofficial and later official envoy to several countries, he later served as a diplomat not only in his father’s administration, but in the administrations of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe. Adams had:
  <ul>
  <li>Negotiated the Anglo American Convention w/ Great Britain 1818</li>
  <li>Negotiated the Adams Onis Treaty purchasing Florida from Spain in 1819</li>
  <li>Negotiated the Russo American Treaty of 1824</li>
  <li>Written the policy paper later known as Monroe Doctrine while serving as Secretary of State for the Monroe Presidency Adams</li>

  <li>Andrew Jackson's Presidency
  <ul>
  <li>Jackson was victorious in the Election of 1828, but the mudslinging of the election had taken a toll on his wife’s spirits. Saying she couldn’t bare the public embarrassment of people knowing she had married him before she was divorced, she begged him to go to Washington alone. He insisted that she go to Washington with him to serve as first lady, but when she was packing she died of a heart attack. Instead of blaming himself for ignoring her pleadings not to run again for the presidency, he blamed all his opponents, the news media, the Eastern establishment, and everyone in Washington for her death. He began his presidency with grudges that stayed with him throughout his presidency.</li>

  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sectional alignments:
  <ul>
  <li>The West and South had early on&nbsp; developed close relationships because they were both agricultural regions and because Farmers in the West had relied on floating their products down the Mississippi River to New Orleans to ship them to foreign markets.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The Market Revolution's Canal Systems and railroads allowed Western farmers to ship their products directly to the East coast for distribution, thus changing sectional alliances with the West and East in alignment and the South unaligned.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Families
  <ul>
  <li>During the Market Revolution the average American family size decreased slightly, probably because (1) the unhealthy conditions of city life were not as conducive to conception and childbirth as rural life and (2) decreased opportunities for conception with the male member of the household often spending months away from home working in factories.</li>
